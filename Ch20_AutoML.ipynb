This process is called meta-learning, and our data will be ingested by the AutoML and the appropriate pre-processing will be selected based on what has been learned from other problems in the past. \n","In this section we will take you through how to install Auto-SkLearn, how to run it on our credit use-case, how to generate a full machine learning pipeline for our classification problem, and how to generate diagnostic data to understand why it has done what it has done. The result will probably be effective, it will also be free of the behavioural biases and any errors we would bring as data scientists to the problem, but it will also be much more opaque that a solution we would generate manually."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xWAxvwxgvObr"},"source":["## Install Auto-SkLearn\n","\n","Some packages only work on certan operating systems (or containers).
