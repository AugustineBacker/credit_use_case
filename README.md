# credit_use_case

This contains uses-cases for two chapters in the forthcoming ML text from Gopal, Philps and Weyde. 
The use case notebooks are companion workbooks for the text in the chapters, so are cut down in nature and only intended to demonstrate the steps described in detail in the text itself.
