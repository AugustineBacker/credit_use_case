        "\n",
        "A Governance framework ensures models in an organisation achieve all their key stakeholder requirements satisfactorily, and in a safe, verifiable way. In this section we introduce functions we will use lter in thje use-case to control and monitor model development process to ensure our aims are achieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Manys steps in a Governance Framework are qualitative, requiring professionals to assess, specify, approve or reject stages in model development. However, quantitative tools can be a powerful utility, allowing professionals to control and monitor a process, and reach judgements about model design, stability, and efficacy. \n",
        "\n",
        "We discuss the 5 stages of model development and the utility functions that can be used to support the Governance Framework:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Stage1: Business Analysis\n",
        "We first define our stakeholder KPIs, which should be systematically defined. We introduce example functions that go some way to representing stakeholder KPIs, with visualizations, statistical tests and checks where appropriate. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Stage2: Data Process\n",
        "Exploratory data analysis goes some way to examining the quality and nature of the data, looking at distributions, correlations, imbalances in the data. We use some utility functions to support this.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Stage3: Model Design and Development\n",
        "From a governance point of view, model design and development is more qualitative, and requires good practice, statitically and in terms of the code implementation. Good commenting is essential, sanity checking of input and return values is advised, and in Python clear parameter declaration and control of source code, and code versions is essential too. \n",
        "We also need to ensure that the outcomes of our model are fair to different population groups, as well as having a good precision to protect the business from loan losses. We will introduce functions to ensure fairness.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Stage4: Model Deployment\n",
        "Model deployment involes multiple stages of testing and authorization. We propose a challenger model to conduct part of this process, which is also used in the monitoring and reporting stage also.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Stage5: Monitoring/Reporting\n",
        "During live running of the models, monitoring of data drift is essential, and for additional safety a challenger model can be run in parallel to the live model, to ensure the live model is functioning well with respect to stakeholder KPIs.\n"

As the model will be used to make credit decisions which will expose tyhe business to losses, regulatory risk and more, this is a high risk application requiring higher levels of Governance scrutiny. \n",
        "We also need to establish who the stakeholders are, and specify analytics to verify that we are attaining good performance on each stakeholder's key performance indicators (KPI).

It is also important to explain to customers why they did not achieve a positive credit decision too. This can be captured by examining the FP rate, using accuracy.

Decision Trees, for instance, have inductive biases associated with greedy separation, whereas Random Forests (RF) mitigate this bias by using many randomized decision trees, but in turn introduce (lesser) inductive biases associated with the way an RF's underlying decision trees are contructed. One mitigant is to ensemble different learners, using a soft-max function or a voting approach.

Note that our model selection function, auto_classifier_selection, allowed us to generate a range of classifiers, we can use one or all of these classifiers as our challenger. If we decided to ensemble the classifiers as our live model (ir combine the results of all in a voting ensemble for instance) we can select the best single model as our challeger.
